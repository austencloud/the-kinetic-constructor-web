/**
 * Sequence Machine
 *
 * This is the main entry point for the sequence state machine. It re-exports
 * the sequence machine from the modern implementation, which provides backward
 * compatibility with the legacy machine API while using the new container-based
 * implementation.
 *
 * MIGRATION NOTE: This file maintains the same API as the original sequence machine
 * but uses the new container-based implementation under the hood. Components
 * should gradually migrate to using the container directly.
