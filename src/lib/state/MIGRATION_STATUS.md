# State Management Migration Status

## Components Migrated

### Core Navigation Components
- ✅ **MenuBar.svelte** - Updated to use appActions for tab navigation
- ✅ **NavWidget.svelte** - Updated to use appSelectors and appActions for tab state
- ✅ **SettingsButton.svelte** - Updated to use appActions for settings dialog

### Core Application Components
- ✅ **MainWidget.svelte** - Updated to use appSelectors and appActions for app state
- ✅ **MainLayout.svelte** - Updated to use appSelectors and appActions for layout state

## Components Still to Migrate

### Sequence Generation Components
- ❌ **GenerateTab.svelte** - Needs to use sequence machine for generation state
- ❌ **CircularSequencer.svelte** - Needs to use sequence machine and settings store
- ❌ **FreeformSequencer.svelte** - Needs to use sequence machine and settings store

### Visualization Components
- ❌ **Pictograph.svelte** - Needs to use sequence store for sequence data
- ❌ **SequenceWorkbench.svelte** - Needs to use sequence store for sequence data

### Background Components
- ❌ **BackgroundCanvas.svelte** - Needs to use app state machine for background state
- ❌ **BackgroundProvider.svelte** - Needs to use settings store for background settings

### Object Components
- ❌ **Grid.svelte** - Needs to use settings store for grid settings
- ❌ **Prop.svelte** - Needs to use sequence store for prop data
- ❌ **Arrow.svelte** - Needs to use sequence store for arrow data

## Migration Approach

For each component:

1. **Identify State Dependencies**:
   - What state does the component read?
   - What state does the component update?

2. **Replace Imports**:
   - Replace old store imports with new state management imports

3. **Update State Access**:
   - Replace direct state access with store subscriptions or selectors

4. **Update State Updates**:
   - Replace direct state updates with action creators

5. **Test the Component**:
   - Verify that the component works correctly with the new state management

## Next Steps

1. Migrate the sequence generation components
2. Migrate the visualization components
3. Migrate the background components
4. Migrate the object components
5. Test the entire application with the new state management system
