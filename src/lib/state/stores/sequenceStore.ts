/**
 * Sequence Store
 *
 * This is the main entry point for the sequence state. It re-exports the
 * sequence store from the adapter, which provides backward compatibility
 * with the legacy store API while using the modern container implementation.
 *
 * MIGRATION NOTE: This file maintains the same API as the original sequence store
 * but uses the new container-based implementation under the hood. Components
 * should gradually migrate to using the container directly.

// No additional subscription is needed here.
