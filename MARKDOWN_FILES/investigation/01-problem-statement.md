# Problem Statement

## 🚨 Initial Issue

**Issue**: `effect_update_depth_exceeded` error causing infinite reactive loops in Svelte 5 application

**Error Message**: 
```
Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a reactive block or effect repeatedly sets a new value.
```

**Location**: Svelte internal reactive system (`chunk-6WBZWPGC.js`, `hook.js`)

## 🔍 Error Pattern

**Console Output**:
```
hook.js:608 Last ten effects were: (10) [ƒ, ƒ, ƒ, ƒ, ƒ, ƒ, ƒ, ƒ, ƒ, ƒ]
chunk-6WBZWPGC.js:176 Uncaught Svelte error: effect_update_depth_exceeded
```

## ⏰ Timing Characteristics

- **When**: Occurs AFTER successful app initialization
- **Where**: Happens in Svelte's internal reactive system
- **Specificity**: No specific file/line numbers (only Svelte internals)
- **Frequency**: Continuous infinite loop until browser crashes

## 🎯 Initial Observations

**What Works**:
- ✅ App initialization completes successfully
- ✅ All logged effects fire exactly once initially
- ✅ No obvious circular callback chains in application code
- ✅ Components render correctly before the loop starts

**What Fails**:
- ❌ Infinite loop occurs in Svelte's internal reactive system
- ❌ Browser becomes unresponsive due to continuous effect execution
- ❌ No clear stack trace pointing to application code

## 🔬 Investigation Scope

This investigation aims to:

1. **Identify the root cause** of the infinite reactive loops
2. **Systematically eliminate suspects** through controlled testing
3. **Develop debugging techniques** for Svelte 5 reactive issues
4. **Implement targeted fixes** that preserve functionality
5. **Document patterns** to prevent similar issues in the future

## 🚨 Impact Assessment

**Severity**: Critical - Application completely unusable
**Scope**: Affects entire application startup and runtime
**User Experience**: Browser freeze, requires force refresh
**Development Impact**: Blocks all development and testing activities
