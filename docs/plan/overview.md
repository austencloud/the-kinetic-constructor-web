# 📊 Current State Analysis & V2 Vision

## 🔍 **Current State Analysis**

### **Technical Debt Identified:**
- ❌ XState machines mixed with Svelte stores
- ❌ Redux/React patterns in Svelte app
- ❌ Legacy writable stores alongside runes
- ❌ Complex dev scripts working around issues
- ❌ 15+ debug/test routes indicating instability
- ❌ Multiple state management patterns competing
- ❌ Heavy dependencies (Redux, XState, React-Redux)

### **App Purpose Understanding:**
✅ **Kinetic Constructor** - Visual pictograph/choreography creation tool
✅ Background animations with performance monitoring
✅ Sequence editing and pictograph manipulation
✅ First-time setup flow and settings management
✅ Export capabilities with image rendering

## 🎯 **V2 Vision: Born in 2025**

### **Core Principles:**
1. **Pure Svelte 5 Runes** - Zero legacy patterns
2. **Launcher Architecture** - Hot-swappable versions
3. **Zero Technical Debt** - Clean slate approach
4. **Modern TypeScript** - Strict typing throughout
5. **Performance First** - Optimized for smooth animations
6. **Developer Experience** - Instant feedback, no restarts

### **Key Innovations:**

**🚀 Independent Launcher System**
- Manages multiple versions (V1, V2, future versions)
- Side-by-side comparison and performance metrics
- One-click version switching
- Future-proof architecture

**⚡ Modern Tech Stack**
- Svelte 5 with pure runes (no legacy stores)
- Modern TypeScript with strict typing
- Minimal dependencies (eliminate Redux, XState)
- Performance-first canvas rendering

**🎨 Clean Architecture**
- Separation of concerns
- Modular component system
- Pure utility functions
- Comprehensive type safety

## 🎯 **Why This Approach?**

### **Risk Mitigation**
- V1 remains untouched and functional
- Launcher provides immediate value
- Progressive migration path
- Zero downtime during development

### **Developer Experience**
- Hot reloading without restarts
- Built-in debugging tools
- Performance monitoring
- Clean, maintainable code

### **Future Scalability**
- Ready for V3, V4, experimental branches
- Independent version deployments
- Team collaboration friendly
- Clear ownership boundaries
