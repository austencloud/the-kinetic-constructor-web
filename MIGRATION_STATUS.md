# State Management Migration Status

This document tracks the progress of migrating the application's state management to use XState and centralized stores.

## Components

### GenerateTab Components

| Component                | Status      | Notes                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GenerateTab.svelte       | Ready       | Fully prepared with commented-out code for new state management |

| FreeformSequencer.svelte | Ready       | Fully prepared with commented-out code for new state management |
| LengthSelector.svelte    | Not Started |                                                                 |

| PropContinuity.svelte    | Not Started |                                                                 |
| LevelSelector.svelte     | Not Started |                                                                 |
| GenerateButton.svelte    | Not Started |                                                                 |
| GeneratorToggle.svelte   | Not Started |                                                                 |

### State Management

| Component          | Status    | Notes                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| sequenceMachine.ts | Completed | Updated to handle sequence generation with dynamic imports |
| settingsStore.ts   | Completed | Created new centralized settings store                     |
| sequenceStore.ts   | Completed | Integrated with sequence machine                           |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Activate the new state management in GenerateTab.svelte by uncommenting the imports and reactive declarations
2. ✅ Complete the migration of CircularSequencer.svelte by uncommenting the new state management code
3. ✅ Complete the migration of FreeformSequencer.svelte by uncommenting the new state management code
4. Update UI control components (LengthSelector, TurnIntensity, etc.) to use the settings store
5. ✅ Activate the sequence machine integration in sequenceStore.ts
6. ✅ Test the sequence generation with the new state management system
7. Remove old store implementations once migration is complete and tested

## Migration Strategy

1. Create new state management components (machines, stores)
2. Prepare components for migration with commented-out code
3. Gradually migrate components one by one
4. Test each migration step
5. Remove old state management code once migration is complete
